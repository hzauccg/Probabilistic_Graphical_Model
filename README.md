About
--------

This repo is about homeworks and projects of the course [**Machine Discovery**](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/Courses/MD.htm) of National Taiwan University (offered by [**Shou-De Lin**](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/)):

Models:
- Bayesian Network
- Markov Random Field
- Conditional Random Field

Inference:
- Queries: Conditional Probability, Likelihood, Most Probable Assignment
- Variable Elimination (dynamic programming)
- Variable Elimination and Factor graph: "Clique Tree"
- Variational Approximate Inference: Mean Field Approximation, Expectation Propagation
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) methods and Gibbs Sampling


Learning (Parameter Estimation):
- Maximun Likelihood Estimation and Bayesian Networks
- Conjugate Priors
- Gradient Ascent for MRF
- Incomplete Data: Expectationâ€“Maximization(EM) algorithm

Content

Article Decoding Task
- Cryptography and Ancient Script Article Analysis
- Construct a Bayesian Network to play as a functional approximation of a probabilistic encoding function
- Task 1: provided with bigram language model of English and the encoding probabilities
- Task 2: only provided with constraints about encoding probabilities
- Optimize the likelihood function by Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm

Discover Hidden Links in a Heterogeneous Graph 
- Given indirect information: aggregative statistics (count of citations), node or link attributes (be-friend-of, own...)
- Discover unseen type of links
- [Paper Ref](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487614)
